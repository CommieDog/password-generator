# Password Generator
A webpage that generates random passwords based on user input


## Introduction 

This project is a tech demo of basic JavaScript functionality and a relief for those who can't come up with strong passwords on their own. It consists of a simple website with basic styling that invites the user to press a button in order to generate a password. The website prompts the user to enter a few basic parameters and displays the resulting password for the user to write down (or try to commit to memory only to forget at an inconvienient time).
